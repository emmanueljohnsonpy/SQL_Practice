A database is an organized collection of data that is stored, managed, and accessed electronically. It allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, update, and delete data. Databases are essential for applications that need to handle large amounts of structured information, such as websites, e-commerce platforms, banking systems, and more.

## Types of Databases:

### Relational Databases (SQL-based)
- Store data in tables with rows and columns.
- Use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing data.
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle DB

### NoSQL Databases
- Store data in flexible formats (documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide columns).
- Suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column-based), Neo4j (graph-based)

### Cloud Databases
- Hosted and managed on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
- Examples: Amazon RDS, Firebase, Google BigQuery

### In-Memory Databases
- Store data in RAM for faster access.
- Examples: Redis, Memcached

### Graph Databases
- Store and manage relationships between data efficiently.
- Example: Neo4j
