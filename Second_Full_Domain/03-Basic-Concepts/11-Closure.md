In PostgreSQL (psql), the term "closure" can have different meanings depending on the context:

1. **Transitive Closure (Graph Queries)**  
    In SQL, transitive closure is used to find all reachable nodes from a given node in a graph (e.g., hierarchy, parent-child relationships). PostgreSQL provides Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to compute transitive closure.  
    Example: Finding all descendants in an employee hierarchy

    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE employee_closure AS (
         SELECT id, name, manager_id FROM employees WHERE id = 1  -- Start from a specific employee
         UNION
         SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
         FROM employees e
         INNER JOIN employee_closure ec ON e.manager_id = ec.id
    )
    SELECT * FROM employee_closure;
    ```
    This query finds all employees reporting (directly or indirectly) to the employee with id = 1.

2. **Function Closure (PL/pgSQL)**  
    PostgreSQL supports anonymous functions (DO blocks) and stored procedures. Closures refer to functions that retain access to variables from their defining scope. PL/pgSQL allows capturing variables within functions but does not support full closures like Python or JavaScript.  
    Example: Using a variable inside a function

    ```sql
    DO $$ 
    DECLARE 
         base_salary NUMERIC := 50000;
    BEGIN
         PERFORM base_salary * 1.1; -- Retains access to `base_salary`
    END $$;
    ```
    The `base_salary` variable is enclosed within the DO block and accessible throughout.

3. **Transaction Closure**  
    PostgreSQL transactions close when you issue `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`. Ensuring ACID compliance requires proper transaction closure.  
    Example: Explicit transaction closure

    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
    COMMIT; -- Transaction closure
    ```
